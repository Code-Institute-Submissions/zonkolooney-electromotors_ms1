# Electromotors  
## Sales and repair of Electric Motors
## How can we solve YOUR problem today?

 This is a website developed with the intent of making life easier for both experienced and novice machine operators and repair/maintenance personnel who may have difficulty sourcing spares - or help - quickly.   
 It's raison d'etre is to allow the user to make immediate contact to establish either the availability of replacement machinery or to explore the feasabilty of repair to such items.    
 It features a general yet broad content of what Electromotors can do to solve a problem without the user necessarily needing to understand the complexity of what they are trying to fix.  
 The ultimate objective is to develop a stand-alone APP eventually in conjunction with the website, to improve real-time responses in the future.

#### Inspecting and repairing commutators on the Repairs page was greatly assisted by the use of some very clear images of the methods used which I copied from
 (https://www.howacarworks.com/electrical-systems/replacing-dynamo-brushes) with the only modification being resizing to suit the page layout.

#### For the Bearing Replacement section of this same page I was impressed by the quality of the images on both of the following sites

# BUGS and swatting them!
+ MAJOR problems with displaying NAVBAR correctly - might reconsider use of Bootstrap. Problem arises on responsive resizing down to to mobile now even though my original design was working fine there on start-up.
+ Came across a difficulty with text below rows of photograph not aligning properly. Top heights of text are different
+ **** Learn how to align text at the bottom of a div  
+ Kevin on suupport page VERY helpful on a rainy Sunday afternoon - helped me clear a VERY resilient cache that even survived a complete reboot!
