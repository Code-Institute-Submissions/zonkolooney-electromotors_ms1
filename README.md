# Electromotors  
## Sales and repair of Electric Motors
## How can we solve YOUR problem today?

 This is a website developed with the intent of making life easier for both experienced and novice machine operators and repair/maintenance personnel who may have difficulty sourcing spares - or help - quickly.   
 It's raison d'etre is to allow the user to make immediate contact to establish either the availability of replacement machinery or to explore the feasabilty of repair to such items.    
 It features a general yet broad content of what Electromotors can do to solve a problem without the user necessarily needing to understand the complexity of what they are trying to fix.  
 The ultimate objective is to develop a stand-alone APP eventually in conjunction with the website, to improve real-time responses in the future.

## BUGS discovered during development and swatting them!
+ MAJOR problems with displaying NAVBAR correctly - might reconsider use of Bootstrap. Problem arises on responsive resizing down to to mobile now even though my original design was working fine there on start-up.

    + Originally intended to design my own bespoke navbar but solved the problem by using BootstrapCDN methods. Made a HUGE difference with responsiveness
+ Came across a difficulty with text below rows of photograph not aligning properly. Top heights of text are different

    + Resolved the problem by restricting the size of the images to be uniform and susbequently carefully selecting what test to use for uniformity
+ Caching causing problems with previewing the website
    + Kevin on support page VERY helpful on a rainy Sunday afternoon - helped me clear a VERY resilient cache that even survived a complete reboot!
+ Responsiveness obliterated almost completely on some devices
    + Altered the position of some Horizontal Rules that I had added late on in the design. Whilst making a difference to the overall appearance, were in the wrong positions within DIVs and were causing distortion.
+ Errors on video display controls
    +   Obtained the latest video link for YouTube from my colleagues in Minimotor, along with permission to use same.
+ Logo on navigation bar was not linking back to the Home page
    + Changed the href "#" to the href for the index.html 
+ Links on the footer Logo displays not opening correctly on new tabs as intended
    + Altered the href by adding _blank to each one to ensure compliance
 
## Testing relative to User Stories

### First Time Visitor 

+ #### As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation
    + The navigation banner, present on all pages, clearly indicates the purpose with 3 links defined.
    + On the Sales page there are four clearly defined product areas.
    + On the Repairs page there are clear diagrams, accompanied by simple and concise explanations accessible by scrolling and/or clicking on menu button. The end of each section shows an option to return to the repairs menu.

+ #### I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.
    + All navigation links have been tested to ensure that they send the user to the correct page.
    + The logo on each page has been tested to ensure that it links back to the Home page

+ #### To be able to understand what services can be offered
    + In general the feedback from seven different volunteers was that the bare bones of what we do in Electromotors was accurately announced, there was room for more webpages which could develop the information in a much broader sense. I explained that the current brief was for 3 pages
    + Feedback following this explanation resulted in a "less is more" rewrite of some information to avoid confusion. In essence what I did was to slim down the information displayed to avoid overload from a UX perspective.

+ #### To be guided as to what information I need to impart
    + The general feedback from this was that I did NOT achieve that goal in any meaningful way at this stage. I intend to return to this issue by developing sub-pages for both Sales and Repairs where the nitty gritty that i decided not to implement in the original  pages as explained above would be more desirable. One example would be with the Sales page and the section on Three Phase motors that I could explain in depth what types there were and include a form for the client to ask about specifics

+ #### To know Electromotors location and opening times.
    + Once again feedback was that this was NOT covered yet and will be considered by adding another main page in the future.

+ #### To be able to navigate the site easily.
    + Through  a process of ongoing opinion from my volunteers, I altered this as I developed the site. The headings were made easier to understand and Repairs, for example was reduced from the former Repairs and Spares title.
    + Following consulation with at least 2 people it was decided that it would be better UX to display the page that was landed on within the Navigation Bar in a larger font in addition to the smaller link on the right hand side. I believe that made a MUCH better impact on the clarity of where the viewer was at any time

### Returning Visitor 

+ #### As a returning visitor to be able to quote a previous Invoice number for repeat enquiries
    + This will be accessible when a Forms page is developed as an extra main page
+ #### to have access to more in-depth explanation about who to ask about spare parts availability and for  guidance for estimated turnaround times on repairs
    + This will be accessible when an About Us page is developed as an extra main page
+ #### to see some sample photographs
    + There ARE some photos include within the various pages but this issue will only be resolved upon development of sub pages
+ #### to be able to make suggestions for improvement
    + This will be accessible when a Forms page is developed as an extra main page

Testing Environments

+ The Website was tested on a variety of commonly used browsers including Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
 + The website was viewed, with thanks to many volunteers, on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung phones of different varieties and iPhones of several generations/versions
+ A large amount of testing, at many stages of the development, was undertaken to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
+ Friends and family members, of which there were a lot of different age groups and technical abilities review the website and, in some cases, accompanying documentation to point out any glaringly apparent bugs and/or user experience issues.

# Features

# Responsiveness
All efforts have been made during testing to ensure responsiveness regardless of the medium being used.

It took some time to iron out various features but was worth it in the end when ALL my volunteers on various different phones, laptops, tablets etc. replied saying that  landscape and portrait views were satisfactory
